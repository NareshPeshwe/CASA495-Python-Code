DUET Sound Seperation Algorithm
===============================

Python code that implements the DUET blind source separation algorithm.

Converted from the MATLAB code from here - https://github.com/yvesx/casa495, which in turn was based on [this publication](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6479-1_8#page-1) and [this website](http://eleceng.ucd.ie/~srickard/bss.html)

It was converted to python to be more 'open source' - not everyone has MATLAB up and running and Octave doesn't do everything MATLAB can. 
All the sound files present it in the Data folder are credited to the original casa495 project.
